# Hello_World
This is a new repository

This is Julie saying hello to everyone who might care to read this.  I'm just starting out into the field of softward development.  As I learn code I've come to have a new appreciation for software developers as well as an ever growing love and excitement about code! Learning code is a CHALLENGE!  I sometimes wonder if I'm even cut out for this type of work, but, through the blood, sweat and tears I am having fun and am looking forward to where this new path in softwar development will take me!
